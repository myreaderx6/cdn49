This is not an uncommon occurrence when I\u2019m around Imagineers, but this time is special. The character isn\u2019t a costume, it\u2019s a robot. And, unlike the m\u200bany animatronic figures you\u2019ve seen in the parks, it\u2019s not stuck in one place. No, this character is walking toward me, attached only by a thin cable used for programming.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The gait is smooth, the arms swing in a lifelike manner and the feet plant realistically. The body sways exactly as you\u2019d expect it to. There\u2019s no other way to say it, it\u2019s ambling. This is Project Kiwi, a small-scale, free-roaming robotic actor \u2014 the first of its kind for Disney and a real robotics milestone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Holy Grail of themed entertainment has been established for decades now: a fully mobile, bipedal character that matches the appearance, personality and scale of the original. Various non-mobile levels of this vision have been achieved at parks around the world, including the incredibly lifelike <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/07\/17\/disney-showed-us-the-inner-workings-of-its-avatar-robot-and-its-just-incredible\/\">Na\u2019Vi Shaman<\/a>, The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/27\/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life\/\">A1000 figure<\/a> that powers characters like Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge\u2019s Hondo Ohnaka and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bJtNxaTwgz0\">smoothly expressive Belle<\/a> from Beauty and the Beast at Tokyo Disneyland. There have also been some cool mobile experiments like <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/panzer\/status\/918301474404175874?s=20\">the self-piloting droid \u201cJake\u201d<\/a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The pint-sized character has accurately rendered textures on its face, hands and feet. It\u2019s dressed in a distressed red flight suit that you may remember from the films. And its eyes are expressive as it looks at me and waves. This is the moment, the one that Disney Imagineers and park goers alike have been waiting decades to realize. This is a real, walkaround character that is at the proper scale, kid scale.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A couple of weeks ago at Walt Disney Imagineering in Southern California, I saw just how close they finally are to making that dream come true. A bipedal platform, developed completely in house over the past three years by WDI researchers and roboticists \u2014 dressed up to look like a roughly two and a half foot tall Groot.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even though the version of Kiwi that I\u2019m looking at is Groot-flavored, it\u2019s important to stress that this is a platform first and foremost, which means that it could take this form when it gets to the parks, or another form entirely. It\u2019s important while developing a character to have a target character that can tell you whether or not you\u2019re hitting an established mark of believability.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kiwi also is still very much a work in progress. I wouldn\u2019t expect to see this in the wild soon; there is still a lot of work to be done on the way that Kiwi works and interacts with people, and WDI does not have immediate plans to put it in the parks.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But even at this stage it\u2019s an incredible feat of engineering that genuinely radiates that elusive characteristic that Disney always searches for with its figures: presence.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/6spi7nBqrro?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">How did we get here?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">I was able to speak to the lead on Project Kiwi, R&amp;D Imagineer Principal Scott LaValley, as well as Advanced Development Studio Executive SVP Jon Snoddy, about how the platform came together over the past few years.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cProject KIWI started about three years ago to figure out how we can bring our smaller characters to life at their actual scale in authentic ways,\u201d LaValley says. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for bipedal robotics and with an incredible team and our combination of technology, artistry and magic, we are bringing characters to life that could not have happened anywhere but Disney.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I\u2019ve talked a bit about the unique Imagineering process in my previous pieces on how Disney <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/08\/disney-has-begun-populating-its-parks-with-autonomous-personality-driven-robots\/\">builds reactive robotics<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/28\/disney-imagineering-has-created-autonomous-robot-stunt-doubles\/\">autonomous stuntbots<\/a> and even <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/27\/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life\/\">entire lands<\/a>. Imagineering works a lot like a startup in the way that it comes up with a problem to solve and then goes about pulling in other departments to help it get a solution. There is a remarkably ego-free nature to much of the way that WDI actually finds those solutions, too. They are as likely to find a key component off the shelf as they are to design, develop and patent it in house.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"zU0CvsKdFs\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/08\/disney-has-begun-populating-its-parks-with-autonomous-personality-driven-robots\/\">Disney has begun populating its parks with autonomous, personality-driven robots<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Disney has begun populating its parks with autonomous, personality-driven robots&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/08\/disney-has-begun-populating-its-parks-with-autonomous-personality-driven-robots\/embed\/#?secret=zU0CvsKdFs\" data-secret=\"zU0CvsKdFs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The interconnected nature of Imagineering departments like ride design, show systems, special effects, animatronics department, Tech Studio R&amp;D and Disney Research means that they share solutions across the stack as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The guiding thread to all of it, of course, is storytelling.

Unfortunately, due to the scale and complexity of the figure and the requirements for interaction and walking, no &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; platforms would do. The fact is that there are actually only a handful of truly viable bipedal robotics platforms anywhere in the world and the vast majority of them are being created for industrial applications, with a handful of &#8220;human-scale&#8221; solutions that are designed as marketing set pieces rather than truly autonomous systems.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So to hit that goal, Imagineering turned to R&amp;D and LaValley\u2019s team. LaValley came to Disney from Boston Dynamics, where he worked on the first version of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QQni8Uz3Q0I\">biped robot Atlas<\/a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The project scope was that they needed a biped robot that was battery powered and could be programmed to handle autonomous interactions with park guests and striped gestures and emotes. The team would take the next three years to build what they needed \u2014 much of which was custom for reasons we\u2019ll get into shortly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142973\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142973\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2142973\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg 3272w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=680,437 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=1536,988 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1317 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142973\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s clear at a glance that Kiwi has no operator inside. The human brain is pretty good at instinctually understanding whether a space is just too small to have a person in it. In order to achieve the small size, the team had to first build a custom skeleton that had room for every motor and actuator Kiwi would need to achieve 50 degrees of freedom, all while keeping it humanoid in shape so that it could be &#8220;dressed up&#8221; as any number of characters.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">First came the frame. Prototypes were built from custom-printed polymer and then eventually custom metal parts using industrial printers. The armatures and segments that they needed to house the critical components were just too complex to mill or cast. The cleverly printed metal skeleton is hollow throughout, allowing a &#8220;marrow conduit&#8221; for air which rushes through the body cooling the motors and actuators. In the current Kiwi prototype the air comes in through the collar area of the suit, flows throughout the body, propelled by fans embedded in the skeleton and exhausts near the bottom of the unit. Eventually it will use the clothing as a shroud to help air flow out near the feet.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Though there is some audible noise, even in this early state it is <i>very<\/i> low, allowing audio playing out of a speaker to enable conversation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As you can see in the exclusive progress video embedded above, the lower sections were built first. Early testing around the office shows the legs and torso sneaking, bouncing, shuffling and strutting through Imagineering. This is probably the only workplace in the world where the bottom half of a torso can tiptoe past your office while you\u2019re eating lunch and it doesn\u2019t even merit a pause between bites.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">An enormous amount of completely custom robotics work went into the Kiwi platform. In the demonstration I saw, young Groot had a safety tether and control cable for live programming, but nothing on the rig itself needed support, it was free roaming with on-board battery power that LaValley says hits around the 45 minute mark currently, with more longevity hoped for in the final version. In fact, a next-generation skeleton is already under development that is lighter and more efficient.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142971\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142971\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2142971\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"603\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg 3544w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=768,452 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=680,401 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=1536,905 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1207 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142971\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc. \/ Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The legs use a system that offers a kinetic counter-balance, allowing the force of having to move and plant a foot to be off-set, making motions more power efficient and quicker. Think of a spring-loaded heavy gate that makes it easier for you to swing open \u2014 but no springs, and a robotic limb instead of a gate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The feet plant realistically for the very simple reason that they must actually support the figure. This gives it an additional layer of believability that just doesn\u2019t happen with externally supported characters that \u201cfake\u201d a foot plant. LaValley demonstrated that the figure could easily stay afoot even if it was shoved gently or if a hand was rested on its shoulder. This kind of self-balancing is something that humans do unconsciously and continuously, but it must be built and programmed in to an ambulatory robot.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"D7TGB2slpL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/28\/disney-imagineering-has-created-autonomous-robot-stunt-doubles\/\">Disney Imagineering has created autonomous robot stunt doubles<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Disney Imagineering has created autonomous robot stunt doubles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/28\/disney-imagineering-has-created-autonomous-robot-stunt-doubles\/embed\/#?secret=D7TGB2slpL\" data-secret=\"D7TGB2slpL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">Many <a href=\"https:\/\/patents.google.com\/patent\/US20200369333A1\">patentable inventions<\/a> went into this creation. One of them is a clever system of gears that translates energy across joints, allowing them to share motors with one another even across a joint like a knee or wrist. This means fewer components and the ability to keep motor and actuator packages small and compact enough to fit underneath theming.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In order to minimize the amount of wiring throughout Kiwi \u2014 since wires are always the biggest points of failure \u2014 the team created a set of origami-like circuit boards joined by integrated flex cabling. Think of your standard computer circuit board but sliced into segments and mounted to the exterior of the hollow &#8220;bones.&#8221; They wrap around the limbs and other body parts, binding the control systems and motors being controlled into a local group that reduces the amount of harnessing that needs to be spread across joints and throughout the structure.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No actuators \u2014 the components that decide how to move a limb \u2014 that exist had the capabilities that the team needed, so they built them from scratch. At one point, LaValley handed me a ring holding iteration after iteration of a dozen actuator elements. I was holding years&#8217; worth of engineering, experimentation, failure and progress on a simple bit of wire twisted together at the end.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Up next for Project Kiwi is a new set of actuators that can dynamically apply torque plus added sensing capabilities for more stability and reaction to uneven ground or interactions. You can imagine that, as a free-roaming character people will want to take pictures with it and I doubt kids would be able to resist running up for a hug. The skeleton must be able to sense and react quickly and smoothly to those sudden external inputs in order to stay upright and keep looking natural.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142970\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142970\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2142970\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"748\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg 2884w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=768,561 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=680,497 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1122 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1496 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142970\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc. \/ Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Moving from a pure IK system to a fully torque-sensing system will allow for the platform to make on the fly adjustments that compensate for terrain or interaction with other performers or guests.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All of the work the team put into custom gearing, motors and actuation has paid off in spades with the ridiculously smooth and natural-looking movements of Kiwi\u2019s arms and legs. Quick waves, shrugs, dance moves and even boxing jabs all look like a real \u2014 if slightly gentle \u2014 creature is performing them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The team also demonstrated the custom-built performance software that they designed, which allows Kiwi to have different kinds of gaits with personality layered on top. The bottom layer is an IK-style gait system that keeps Kiwi upright and walking, but then layering the personalities on top adds character to the walk while still maintaining stability. Bouncy, jaunty walks, limps, sad or downhearted walks, all with the other motions of arms and head contributing to a constantly shifting center of mass and momentum. The paddling duck&#8217;s feet under the water is that gait system that takes the external inputs and integrates it into the walk naturally.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dpJ3y7M9mG\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/27\/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life\/\">How Disney Built Star Wars, in real life<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How Disney Built Star Wars, in real life&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/27\/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life\/embed\/#?secret=dpJ3y7M9mG\" data-secret=\"dpJ3y7M9mG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The current prototype software has a series of set behaviors, with a timeline that allows them to program new behaviors and actions by toggles or adjusting curves that control movement. With a series of tweaks in the software the changes become evident immediately, with Groot\u2019s \u201cmood\u201d becoming immediately evident in his walk.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One moment he is bouncing along swinging his arms jauntily, clearly happy to be there. Then the next moment his arms are slumped, his head is hung and he is slowly plodding \u2014 clearly sad to be leaving the fun behind. It\u2019s a remarkable bit of performance software.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And even though the expressive eyes are already impressive \u2014 the team is not done. Up next on the agenda is a sensory package that allows Kiwi to more fully understand the world around it and to identify people and their faces. This becomes important because eye contact is such an emotive and powerful tool to use in transporting a participant.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even without the sensing software, I can tell you that the experience of this 2.5ft Groot locking eyes with me, smiling and waving was just incredibly transportive. Multiple times throughout my interaction I completely forgot that it was a robot at all.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142990\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/groot-walk-dance.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142990\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2142990 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/groot-walk-dance.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"364\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142990\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc. \/ Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As I mentioned at the top, the Project Kiwi platform still has a lot of work left to do before it makes any appearances in the parks. But it\u2019s already well on the road to being viable for things like stage performances, photo ops and eventually free-roaming deployment in the parks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That is really the vision. Snoddy says that the goal is to move the characters we love from across Disney\u2019s pantheon into the spaces of the guests, elevating the entirety of the park to a live transportive experience, rather than a single ride or dark room. And to do it <i>at the proper scale<\/i> to make them genuine and capable of making guests believe. With these kinds of platforms, the possibilities are there to make the entire parks themselves a living, breathing home for the characters, rather than the tightly controlled environments of the rides themselves.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The arc of history in this Imagineering journey is drawn in robots. From Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, to incredibly expressive characters like the Na\u2019Vi Shaman anchored inside a dark ride, to characters that hold up in bright, well-lit spaces. Project Kiwi is the next frontier, allowing them to step off of the pedestal and right into the world of the guest.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the most fascinating fields in robotics currently is HRI, or human-robot interaction. This multidisciplinary effort to help humans and robots communicate better is often focused on safety and awareness in industrial settings. But I\u2019ve long said that the most incredibly interesting work in this space is being done in Imagineering R&amp;D. More than 100 million people pass through Disney\u2019s parks per year, and the number of opportunities that they have to react to and interact with robotic characters grows yearly. And with projects like Kiwi on the horizon, this field is going to explode with new kinds of data and learnings.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And, of course, we\u2019ll get to meet some of our favorite characters looking and acting as real as we\u2019ve ever seen them in our world.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The black curtain pulls aside and a character straight out of the movies waves hello.

successfully launches astronauts with a re-used Dragon spacecraft for the first time"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">SpaceX has another successful human space launch to its credit, after a good takeoff and orbital delivery of its Crew Dragon spacecraft on Friday morning. The Dragon took off aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:49 AM EDT (2:49 AM EDT). On board were four astronauts, including NASA&#8217;s Megan McArthur and Shane Kimbrough, as well as JAXA&#8217;s Akihiko Hoshide and the ESA&#8217;s Thomas Pesquet.<\/p>\n<p>This was Spacex&#8217;s second official astronaut delivery mission for NASA, after its Crew-1 operation last year. Unlike Crew-1, Crew-2 included use of two re-flown components in the spacecraft system, including the first-stage booster, which was used during the Crew-1 launch, and the Dragon capsule, which was used for SpaceX&#8217;s first-ever human spaceflight, the final demonstration mission of its spacecraft certification program for NASA, which flew Bob Behnken (side note: this mission&#8217;s pilot, McArthur, is Behnken&#8217;s wife) and Doug Hurley to the ISS. SpaceX has characterized the use of re-flown elements as arguably even safer than using new ones, with CEO Elon Musk noting that you wouldn&#8217;t want to be on the &#8220;first flight of an airplane when it comes out of the factory&#8221; during a conversation with Xprize&#8217;s Peter Diamandis on Thursday evening.<\/p>\n<p>Now that the Crew Dragon is in its target transfer orbit, it&#8217;ll be making its way to rendezvous with the Space Station, which will take just under 24 hours. It&#8217;ll be docking with the station early tomorrow morning, attaching to a docking port that was just cleared earlier this month when SpaceX&#8217;s other Crew Dragon relocated to another port on the ISS earlier this month.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This launch also included a recovery attempt for the booster, with a landing at sea using SpaceX&#8217;s drone landing pad. That went as planned, meaning this booster, which has already flown two different sets of human astronauts, could be used to fly yet another after refurbishment.<\/p>\n<p>SpaceX&#8217;s Commercial Crew program with NASA continues to be the key success story in the agency&#8217;s move to partner with more private companies for its research and space exploration missions. NASA also recently tapped <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/16\/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon\/\">SpaceX to develop the human landing system for its Artemis program<\/a>, which will return humans to the moon for the first time since the Apollo program, and which will use SpaceX&#8217;s Starship spacecraft. For SpaceX&#8217;s human spaceflight program, the next big milestone will be its first flight of a mission made up entirely of paying private citizens, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/30\/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission\/\">which is currently set to take place this fall<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WuIGJlicdw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/30\/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission\/\">Last two crewmembers named for SpaceX&#8217;s first all-civilian human spaceflight mission<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Last two crewmembers named for SpaceX&#8217;s first all-civilian human spaceflight mission&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/30\/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission\/embed\/#?secret=WuIGJlicdw\" data-secret=\"WuIGJlicdw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"643JVncd0R\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/16\/whats-next-for-spacetech-9-vcs-look-to-the-future\/\">What&#8217;s next for space tech? 9 VCs look to the future<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;What&#8217;s next for space tech? 9 VCs look to the future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/16\/whats-next-for-spacetech-9-vcs-look-to-the-future\/embed\/#?secret=643JVncd0R\" data-secret=\"643JVncd0R\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SpaceX has another successful human space launch to its credit, after a good takeoff and orbital delivery of its Crew Dragon spacecraft on Friday morning.

href=\"https:\/\/www.nscai.gov\/\"> report<\/a> last month delivering an uncomfortable public message: <em>America is not prepared to defend or compete in the AI era<\/em>. It leads to two key questions that demand our immediate response: Will the U.S. continue to be a global superpower if it falls behind in AI development and deployment? And what can we do to change this trajectory?<\/p>\n<p>Left unchecked, seemingly neutral artificial intelligence (AI) tools can and will perpetuate inequalities and, in effect, automate discrimination.

This has comforted skeptics concerned both about the U.S. commitment to AI development and to ensuring equity in the digital space.<\/p>\n<p>But that will be fleeting unless the administration shows strong resolve in making AI funding a reality and establishing leaders and structures necessary to safeguard its development and use.<\/p>\n<h2>Need for clarity on priorities<\/h2>\n<p>There has been a seismic shift at the federal level in AI policy and in stated commitments to equality in tech. A number of high profile appointments by the Biden administration \u2014 from Dr. Alondra Nelson as deputy of OSTP, to Tim Wu at the NEC, to (our former senior advisor) Kurt Campbell at the NSC \u2014 signal that significant attention will be paid to inclusive AI development by experts on the inside.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nscai.gov\/2021-final-report\/\">NSCAI final report<\/a> includes recommendations that could prove critical to enabling better foundations for inclusive AI development, such as creating new talent pipelines through a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nscai.gov\/2021\/03\/08\/u-s-panel-calls-for-new-digital-service-academy-to-bolster-federal-workforce-science-magazine\/\">U.S. Digital Service Academy<\/a> to train current and future employees.<\/p>\n<p>The report also recommends establishing a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jdsupra.com\/legalnews\/the-u-s-in-the-ai-era-the-national-8471075\/\">Technology Competitiveness Council<\/a> led by the vice president. This could prove essential in ensuring that the nation\u2019s commitment to AI leadership remains a priority at the highest levels. It makes good sense to have the administration\u2019s leadership on AI spearheaded by Vice President Harris in light of her strategic partnership with the president, her <a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2020\/08\/11\/what-kamala-harris-record-says-about-major-ai-policy-issues\/\">tech policy savvy<\/a> and her focus on civil rights.<\/p>\n<h2>The U.S. needs to lead by example<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>We know AI is powerful in its ability to create efficiencies, such as plowing through thousands of resumes to identify potentially suitable candidates. But it can also scale discrimination, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight\/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G\">Amazon hiring tool<\/a> that prioritized male candidates or &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents\/speech\/brainard20210112a.htm\">digital redlining<\/a>&#8221; of credit based on race.<\/p>\n<p>The Biden administration should issue an executive order to agencies inviting ideation on ways AI can improve government operations. The order should also mandate checks on AI used by the USG to ensure it\u2019s not spreading discriminatory outcomes unintentionally.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, there must be a routine schedule in place where AI systems are evaluated to ensure embedded, harmful biases are not resulting in recommendations that are discriminatory or inconsistent with our democratic, inclusive values \u2014 and reevaluated routinely given that AI is constantly iterating and learning new patterns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IEIEeefNJu\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/24\/biased-ai-perpetuates-racial-injustice\/\">Biased AI perpetuates racial injustice<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Biased AI perpetuates racial injustice&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/24\/biased-ai-perpetuates-racial-injustice\/embed\/#?secret=IEIEeefNJu\" data-secret=\"IEIEeefNJu\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Putting a responsible AI governance system in place is particularly critical in the U.S. Government, which is required to offer <a href=\"https:\/\/constitution.congress.gov\/constitution\/amendment-5\/\">due<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/constitutioncenter.org\/interactive-constitution\/amendment\/amendment-xiv\">process<\/a> protection when denying certain benefits. For instance, when AI is used to determine allocation of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/3\/21\/17144260\/healthcare-medicaid-algorithm-arkansas-cerebral-palsy\">Medicaid benefits<\/a>, and such benefits are modified or denied based on an algorithm, the government must be able to explain that outcome, <a href=\"https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1012360\">aptly termed technological due process<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If decisions are delegated to automated systems without<a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1710.00794.pdf)\"> explainability<\/a>, guidelines and human oversight, we find ourselves in the untenable situation where this basic constitutional right is being denied.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, the administration has immense power to ensure that AI safeguards by key corporate players are in place through its procurement power. Federal contract spending was expected to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.govexec.com\/management\/2020\/06\/federal-contract-spending-reaches-its-highest-level-ever-fiscal-2019-marking-4-straight-years-growth\/166484\/\"> exceed $600 billion<\/a> in fiscal 2020, even before including pandemic economic stimulus funds. The USG could effectuate tremendous impact by issuing a checklist for federal procurement of AI systems \u2014 this would ensure the government\u2019s process is both rigorous and universally applied, including relevant civil rights considerations.<\/p>\n<h2>Protection from discrimination stemming from AI systems<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The government holds another powerful lever to protect us from AI harms: its investigative and prosecutorial authority. An executive order instructing agencies to clarify applicability of current laws and regulations (e.g., ADA, Fair Housing, Fair Lending, Civil Rights Act, etc.) when determinations are reliant on AI-powered systems could result in a global reckoning. Companies operating in the U.S. would have unquestionable motivation to check their AI systems for harms against protected classes.<\/p>\n<p>Low-income individuals are disproportionately vulnerable to many of the negative effects of AI. This is especially apparent with regard to <a href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/blogs\/congress-blog\/technology\/459455-making-equitable-access-to-credit-a-reality-in-the-age-of\">credit<\/a> and loan creation, because they are less likely to have access to traditional financial products or the ability to obtain high scores based on traditional frameworks. This then becomes the data used to create AI systems that automate such decisions.<\/p>\n<p>The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) can play a pivotal role in holding financial institutions accountable for discriminatory lending processes that result from reliance on discriminatory AI systems. The mandate of an EO would be a forcing function for statements on how AI-enabled systems will be evaluated, putting companies on notice and better protecting the public with clear expectations on AI use.<\/p>\n<p>There is a clear path to liability when an individual acts in a discriminatory way and<a href=\"https:\/\/constitutioncenter.org\/interactive-constitution\/interpretation\/amendment-xiv\/clauses\/701\"> a due process<\/a> violation when a public benefit is denied arbitrarily, without explanation. Theoretically, these liabilities and rights would transfer with ease when an AI system is involved, but a review of agency action and legal precedent (or rather, the lack thereof) indicates otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>The administration is off to a good start, such as rolling back a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/proposed-hud-rule-on-ai-could-allow-for-housing-discrimination-3d778ea7-8230-4f21-935b-b6b7f384a310.html\"> proposed HUD rule<\/a> that would have made legal challenges against discriminatory AI essentially unattainable. Next, federal agencies with investigative or prosecutorial authority should clarify which AI practices would fall under their review and current laws would be applicable \u2014 for instance, HUD for illegal housing discrimination; CFPB on AI used in credit lending; and the Department of Labor on AI used in determinations made in hiring, evaluations and terminations.<\/p>\n<p>Such action would have the added benefit of establishing a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rootandrebound.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Connecticut-Fair-Housing-Center.pdf\"> useful precedent<\/a> for plaintiff actions in complaints.<\/p>\n<p>The Biden administration has taken encouraging first steps signaling its intent to ensure inclusive, less discriminatory AI. However, it must put its own house in order by directing that federal agencies require the development, acquisition and use of AI \u2014 internally and by those it does business with \u2014 is done in a manner that protects privacy, civil rights, civil liberties and American values.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"uBzJpiLTQ9\"><p><a

But should you give preferential economics or other benefits to a seed anchor investor who makes a material commitment to the fund?<\/p>\n<p>These \u201cVCs for investment management companies\u201d are also known as <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/blog\/what-is-gp-stakes-investing\">GP stake investors<\/a> or fund platforms. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/docsend.com\/view\/7qrk4rpbkajg4uyc?utm_campaign=Email%20%7C%202019-11-22%20DocSend%20Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=107534303&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9iuVvGitQQ7lHTXwcxpkYwXc-JrKQ8mt-CmSwyTNolQadtSK4d0p40fHTBtpt3NQxJzlych_LFBE46WEbb9QzQtM60Og&amp;utm_content=107534303&amp;utm_source=hs_email\">DocSend<\/a>, \u201cAbout half the VC firms in our survey had an anchor LP for their fund, and the average percentage that an anchor LP took in a first-time fund was 25%. The prevalence of anchor LPs among both early-stage and more established firms in our data suggests that securing an anchor investor can be crucial for signaling a firm\u2019s credibility to other potential LPs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, data about whether those anchors received preferential terms are very hard to obtain.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the hedge fund world, fund platforms are common and therefore more transparent,\u201d Ha Duong, the investment principal at Ocean Investment, a single-family office based in Berlin, told me. \u201cIn venture, I haven&#8217;t seen many fund platforms.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A number of firms provide infrastructure for emerging VCs, including <a href=\"http:\/\/capria.vc\">Capria<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.oper8r.io\/\"> Draper Venture Network<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oper8r.io\/\">Oper8r<\/a> and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.recastcapital.com\/\"> Recast Capital<\/a>, and may provide capital or assistance in raising capital.<\/p>\n<p>However, this ecosystem is much more built out in the private equity and hedge fund spaces. Examples include <a href=\"https:\/\/archeancapital.com\/\">Archean Capital Partners<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gatewoodcapital.com\/\">Gatewood Capital Partners<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lafayettesquare.com\/\">Lafayette Square<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nesvold.com\/\">Nesvold Capital Partners<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/reservoircap.com\/\">Reservoir Capital Group<\/a>. Certain family offices also make these investments on an ad-hoc basis. As do some VCs: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lunex.com\/\">LuneX.com<\/a> notes it is a dedicated blockchain and cryptocurrency fund that partners with a Southeast Asia-based VC, Golden Gate Ventures.<\/p>\n<p>A GP stake investor brings some significant advantages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meaningful upfront initial capital<\/strong>, usually greatly shortening the lengthy fundraising process. This can be particularly helpful for founders who do not come from a wealthy background and may not be able to forgo an income for an 18-month fundraising period.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Credibility<\/strong>. This is proportionate to the stake investor\u2019s credibility. Everyone else will assume the GP stake investor did extensive due diligence.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Assistance in business development, marketing, risk management and governance.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Ability to access <\/strong>LPs who require meaningful assets under management (AUM) before they\u2019ll consider you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Back office<\/strong>, in some cases.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There can also be meaningful disadvantages to working with a GP stake investor:<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Raising capital for a new fund is always hard.

platforms over the past year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.introvoke.com\">Introvoke<\/a> co-founder and CEO Oana Manolache predicted that we&#8217;re only at the beginning of a &#8220;third wave of digital transformation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In her framing, the first wave came at the beginning of the pandemic, when everyone was using video conferencing tools like Zoom for their virtual events. Next came conference platforms like Hopin (which has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/04\/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation\/\">raising money at a mind-boggling clip<\/a>). But Manolache argued that even Hopin represents a &#8220;Band-Aid&#8221; that customers are hoping will tide them over until in-person events can resume \u2014 particularly when organizers have to point attendees to a third-party platform.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One size does not fit all,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The Band-Aid solution that was only supposed to last for a couple months has had big benefits as companies grew their customer base and revenue targets. Now we&#8217;ve reached the third wave, as organizations want to bring solutions to their own universe and own their relationship with the audience.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>San Francisco-based Introvoke is a Techstars Accelerator graduate aiming to provide this third-wave solution. It&#8217;s announcing today that it has raised $2.7 million in funding led by Struck Capital, while Comcast, Social Leverage, Great Oaks, V1vc, Time CTO Bharat Krish and Resy co-founder Mike Montero also participated.<\/p>\n<p>The startup offers components like virtual stages, chat rooms and networking hubs, all customizable and embeddable on a customer&#8217;s website. Manolache said Introvoke (the name comes from the idea of &#8220;thought-provoking introductions&#8221;) is designed for a hybrid future, which will take multiple forms: &#8220;Hybrid is going to mean virtual-only events, in-person only events and\u00a0events that have in-person and<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0virtual elements.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2143138\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2143138\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2143138\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG_3806.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Introvoke\" width=\"680\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG_3806.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG_3806.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG_3806.jpeg?resize=300,224 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG_3806.jpeg?resize=768,573 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG_3806.jpeg?resize=680,507 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG_3806.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2143138\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Introvoke<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Introvoke charges customers based on live event minutes, a model that it says is accessible to companies large and small.

For example, Introvoke events can allow for attendees to chat with each other over weeks or months, not just a few days.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Struck Capital founder and Managing Partner Adam B. Struck suggested that virtual events &#8220;will continue far beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now, virtual experiences, from conferences and concerts to company all-hands, are generally hosted on third party platforms, which creates a disjointed experience for the brand or organization hosting the event,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Virtual enablement should be native to the website and platform of the enterprise itself, and it\u2019s the role of technologists like the <span class=\"il\">Introvoke<\/span> team to make these experiences as seamless as any in-person event.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"bq6w95T30M\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/04\/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation\/\">Hopin confirms $400M raise at $5.65B valuation<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

Israeli Air Force, Israeli Intelligence and leading development of a cybersecurity product at Microsoft, Amit Rosenzweig turned his attention to autonomous vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>It was a technology <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">that he soon recognized would need what every other mission-critical system requires: humans.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I understood that there are so many edge cases that will not be solved purely by AI and machine learning, and there must be some kind of human-in-the-loop intervention,&#8221; Rosenzweig said in a recent interview. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have any mission-critical system on the planet \u2014 not nuclear power plants, not airplanes \u2014 without human supervision. A human must be in the loop or present in some way for autonomous mobility to exist, even in 10 or probably 20 years from now.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>That &#8220;human in the loop&#8221; conclusion led Rosenzweig to found teleoperations startup <a href=\"https:\/\/ottopia.tech\/\">Ottopia<\/a> in 2018. (His brother, Oren Rosenzweig is also in the autonomous vehicle business via the lidar company he co-founded, Innoviz.) Ottopia&#8217;s first product is a universal teleoperation platform that allows a human operator to monitor and control any type of vehicle from thousands of miles away. Ottopia&#8217;s software is combined with off-the-shelf hardware components like monitors and cameras to create a teleoperations center. The company&#8217;s software also includes assistive features, which provide &#8220;path&#8221; instructions to the AV without having to remotely control the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>Since launching, the small 25-person company has racked up investors and partners such as BMW, fixed-route AV startup <a href=\"https:\/\/maymobility.com\/\">May Mobility<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/bestmile.com\/\">Bestmile<\/a>. Ottopia said Friday that it has raised $9 million from Hyundai Motor Group as well as Maven and IN Venture, the Israel-focused venture capital arm of Sumitomo Corporation. Existing investors MizMaa and Israeli firm NextGear also participated.<\/p>\n<p>Hyundai and IN Venture also gained board seats. Woongjun Jang, who heads up Hyundai&#8217;s autonomous driving center, and IN Venture managing partner Eyal Rosner, are now on Ottopia&#8217;s board.<\/p>\n<p>Ottopia has raised a total of $12 million to date, and Rosenzweig has already set his sights on a larger round to help fund the company&#8217;s growth.<\/p>\n<p>For now, Rosenzweig is focused on doubling his workforce to 50 people by the end of the year and opening an office in the United States. Rosenzweig said the company is also expanding into other applications of its teleoperations software, including defense, mining and logistics. However, most of Ottopia&#8217;s resources will continue to be dedicated to automotive, and specifically the deployment of autonomous cars, trucks and shuttles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The motivation is really simple \u2014 it&#8217;s simple but it&#8217;s hard to do \u2014 and that&#8217;s to make affordable autonomous transportation closer to reality,&#8221; Rosenzweig said. &#8220;The problem of course is that when an AV does not have any kind of backup or any kind of safety net in the form of teleoperations and it gets stuck, passengers are going to get anxious, &#8216;what&#8217;s going on, why, why is this not moving&#8217;.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The other problem, Rosenzweig noted, is that AVs need to be combined with an efficient transit service. That&#8217;s where he sees his newest partner, on-demand shuttle and transit software company Via, coming in.<\/p>\n<p>Under the partnership, which was also announced this week, Via will offer autonomous vehicle fleets that combine its fleet management software with Ottopia&#8217;s teleoperations platform. Via is not developing its own self-driving software system. In November 2020, Via <a href=\"https:\/\/maymobility.com\/may-mobility-and-via-announce-partnership-that-will-integrate-on-demand-avs-into-public-transit\/\">announced it had partnered<\/a> with May Mobility to launch an autonomous vehicle platform that integrates on-demand shared rides, public transportation and transit options for passengers with accessibility needs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"t0HxVdd2Hk\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/26\/ethics-in-the-age-of-autonomous-vehicles\/\">Ethics in the age of autonomous vehicles<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Ethics in the age of autonomous vehicles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/26\/ethics-in-the-age-of-autonomous-vehicles\/embed\/#?secret=t0HxVdd2Hk\" data-secret=\"t0HxVdd2Hk\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After spending much of his career in mission-critical environments, including the Israeli Air Force, Israeli Intelligence and leading development of a cybersecurity product at Microsoft, Amit Rosenzweig turned his attention to autonomous vehicles.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context\/\">pre-direct-listing hype<\/a>\u00a0Coinbase enjoyed? After reporting its estimated first-quarter financial performance, interest in the domestic cryptocurrency trading giant ran red-hot.<\/p>\n<p>When Coinbase set a $250 per-share direct listing <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/13\/coinbase-sets-direct-listing-reference-price-at-250-share-valuing-the-company-at-as-much-as-65b\/\">reference price<\/a>, it was broadly viewed as modest, if not downright low. Of course, a reference price is just that &#8212; a reference &#8212; so it wasn&#8217;t too big a deal. But it also wasn&#8217;t surprising that Coinbase shares traded as high as $429.54 on their first day, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/COIN\/history?p=COIN\">Yahoo Finance data<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Coinbase equity hasn&#8217;t topped $400 in any following day and is now under the $300 mark, with more declines set to arrive as trading commences. Its reference price looms, and suddenly a price that felt intensely conservative before Coinbase began to trade is starting to look nearly reasonable.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.\u00a0 <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Read it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/?tpcc=theexchange\">every morning on Extra Crunch<\/a> or get <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">The Exchange newsletter<\/a> every Saturday.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/?tpcc=theexchange\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>There have been other notable declines in value among some recently public, more technologically differentiated companies.

A way that empowers young people to achieve in-demand skills while avoiding the decades-long burden of student loans. A way that doesn\u2019t discriminate based on socioeconomic background while exposing talent-hungry employers to a new pool of qualified, driven individuals.<\/p>\n<p>In the explosion of edtech businesses with new approaches, we are in danger of overlooking an established model that can be adapted to solve these challenges. That model is apprenticeships.<\/p>\n<h2>The apprenticeship movement<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a lingering perception in America that apprenticeships are the province of construction and building trades, or even medieval guilds like smithing and glass-blowing. Well, not anymore. While we\u2019ve been focused on edtech, or despairing over the widening skills gap, apprenticeships have been rebooted. Modern, tech-driven apprenticeships are emerging as a faster, cheaper and more impactful alternative to higher education.<\/p>\n<p>In Europe, tech companies \u2014 and nontech companies <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2021\/02\/02\/ibm-salaries-jobs-training-new-collar-covid-economy\/\">increasingly hiring entry-level workers<\/a> with discrete tech skills \u2014 are already leveraging<a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2021\/02\/02\/ibm-salaries-jobs-training-new-collar-covid-economy\/\"> apprenticeships<\/a> to provide a direct route into the labor market for diverse talent.\u00a0From software engineers to data analysts, the apprentice of the 21st century is as likely to wield a keyboard as a wrench.<\/p>\n<p>Fully employed from day one, apprentices earn a wage while they learn on a program that is entirely free to the individual. Their training is delivered alongside their role, with this applied learning approach ensuring relevant skills are tested and embedded right away.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"iz2bt8UmN9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/28\/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream\/\">13 investors say lifelong learning is taking edtech mainstream<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;13 investors say lifelong learning is taking edtech mainstream&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/28\/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream\/embed\/#?secret=iz2bt8UmN9\" data-secret=\"iz2bt8UmN9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Part of the challenge presented by the existing system is that college provides a single shot of learning at the start of a career, with a focus on knowledge rather than skills. Instead of time-consuming traditional education models, we should be encouraging companies to focus on training individuals for highly skilled jobs and adapting training as roles shift through a lifelong learning journey.<\/p>\n<p>Against a college system churning out graduates armed with knowledge of limited applicability in the workplace, apprentices have real-work experience and transferable skill sets in the tech and digital spaces.<\/p>\n<p>As we write this, tech <a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.proofpoint.com\/v2\/url?u=https-3A__www.dol.gov_agencies_eta_apprenticeship_about_statistics&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=lh-GS1bPsHrzsbzOgSkhYGdgop6VmM2MpUREk013alE&amp;e=\">apprenticeships represent less than 1% of American apprenticeships <\/a>, while <a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.proofpoint.com\/v2\/url?u=https-3A__www.dol.gov_agencies_eta_apprenticeship_about_statistics&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=lh-GS1bPsHrzsbzOgSkhYGdgop6VmM2MpUREk013alE&amp;e=\">78% of apprentices are white<\/a>. But change is in the air. In recent weeks, the Biden administration has gone out of its way to highlight tech as a growth area for apprenticeships.<\/p>\n<p>The president also announced <a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.proofpoint.com\/v2\/url?u=https-3A__www.whitehouse.gov_briefing-2Droom_statements-2Dreleases_2021_02_17_fact-2Dsheet-2Dbiden-2Dadministration-2Dto-2Dtake-2Dsteps-2Dto-2Dbolster-2Dregistered-2Dapprenticeships_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=iRWri3Hob0ohVZ8HwRyyF3b9musmHkEyUmPWiFdtUlo&amp;e=\">his commitment to raising apprenticeship standards<\/a>, starting with casting off industry-recognized apprenticeship programs lacking in quality and training rigor.<\/p>\n<p>These aren\u2019t just words, either. The apprenticeship reboot will be powered by a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/117th-congress\/house-bill\/447\">National Apprenticeship Act <\/a>. This proposed legislation commits $3 billion over the next five years to expanding registered apprenticeship programs across a range of industries. If it\u2019s done right, tech will be front and center.<\/p>\n<h2>The benefit to businesses<\/h2>\n<p>All this is welcome good news for businesses desperate to close skills gaps. As roles evolve at an ever-faster pace, it\u2019s becoming more and more difficult to know what a college degree actually says about an individual\u2019s ability. Yes, they went to a \u201cgood\u201d school. But when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/half-of-young-americans-say-college-isnt-necessary-2019-08-06\">half of Americans say their degree is irrelevant to their current role<\/a>, how does prestige translate to jobs, let alone ability to perform in the workplace?<\/p>\n<p>Increasingly operating in the dark, tech businesses and nontech managers hiring for tech roles are competing with each other to poach experienced talent into senior roles. It\u2019s continuing to fish in a very limited, homogeneous pool and an expensive short-term solution.<\/p>\n<p>Professional apprenticeships allow business leaders to be more strategic and proactive in their hiring practices. They can mold apprentices to the roles they actually need to fill while focusing on their organization\u2019s specific requirements. It beats relying on uniform, outdated education models.<\/p>\n<p>Better still, by training apprentices from the start of their career, companies inspire loyalty and eliminate the tricky transition phase recent grads and external hires usually need.\u00a0Once converted to full-time employees, apprentices tend to persist for twice as long as traditional direct hires.<\/p>\n<p>While skills gaps are created by the future racing toward us, racial inequalities are rooted in our past. Professional apprenticeships help break down entrenched structural barriers to careers in industries like tech.<\/p>\n<p>Most important, they look beyond the degree requirements that screen out 67% of Black and 79% of Hispanic Americans. Because apprenticeships are paid pathways to economic opportunity, they truly level the playing field and allow companies to make genuine advances toward racial equality &#8212; beyond a few neatly crafted Instagram posts. Meanwhile, by tapping into diverse talent pools early, businesses can develop individuals and build real, recognizable routes to the boardroom.<\/p>\n<p>They would be right, too. A 2020 report by McKinsey found companies with the highest diversity <a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.proofpoint.com\/v2\/url?u=https-3A__www.mckinsey.com_business-2Dfunctions_organization_our-2Dinsights_why-2Ddiversity-2Dmatters&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=nkaIrANwm3SsODk5tOu6CCoL5GD9gNjXTD2GnkuxMPo&amp;e=\">earned 35% more than their industry average<\/a>. Similarly, the share returns of the most diverse companies in the S&amp;P 500 outperformed the least diverse by a staggering 240%.<\/p>\n<p>The time for change is now.\u00a0According to the National Center for Education Statistics, <a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.proofpoint.com\/v2\/url?u=https-3A__www.insidehighered.com_quicktakes_2020_02_18_41-2Drecent-2Dgrads-2Dwork-2Djobs-2Dnot-2Drequiring-2Ddegree&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=j38_kYCF6Jer06vbpAMLko-hKZj7SVnEu38MpfpEdsk&amp;e=\">41% of grads end up in roles that don\u2019t require a degree<\/a>. With COVID-19 hitting young workers particularly hard, this figure is set to rise unless we embrace new approaches, including professional apprenticeships.

And like every other week in recent memory, it was a busy one. But we did our best to hit some M&amp;A news, some unicorn news and some funding news from smaller startups.<\/p>\n<p>Now, onto the show rundown; here&#8217;s what we discussed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/discord-ipo-microsoft-deal\/\">Discord-Microsoft deal is done<\/a>, and Danny has a hot take. Namely, in his view, the deal was mostly banker chatter more than a real possibility. More chaff than wheat, in other words. Agree or not, we&#8217;re stoked for the Discord IPO in a few years (quarters?) time.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/mastercard-is-acquiring-identity-verification-company-ekata-for-850m\/\">Mastercard bought Erkata<\/a>, and Danny was on hand to explain why we care about the deal. Sure, it was $825 million in value, but some venture data from <a href=\"https:\/\/finledger.com\/2021\/04\/19\/mastercard-purchases-identity-verification-company-ekata-its-6th-known-acquisition-to-exceed-a-100m-purchase-price\/\">Finledger helped explain just how much capital is flowing into similar companies<\/a>. Let&#8217;s see how\u00a0<em>that<\/em> math works out.<\/li>\n<li>Clearbanc rebranded itself <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco\/\">into a fintech unicorn,<\/a> providing services along with sweet, sweet capital.<\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/21\/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company\/\">UiPath IPO finally priced<\/a> and started to trade.

Imagineering\u2019s Project Kiwi is a free-walking robot that will make you believe in Groot"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">The black curtain<\/span> pulls aside and a character straight out of the movies waves hello. This is not an uncommon occurrence when I\u2019m around Imagineers, but this time is special. The character isn\u2019t a costume, it\u2019s a robot. And, unlike the m\u200bany animatronic figures you\u2019ve seen in the parks, it\u2019s not stuck in one place. No, this character is walking toward me, attached only by a thin cable used for programming.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The gait is smooth, the arms swing in a lifelike manner and the feet plant realistically. The body sways exactly as you\u2019d expect it to. There\u2019s no other way to say it, it\u2019s ambling. This is Project Kiwi, a small-scale, free-roaming robotic actor \u2014 the first of its kind for Disney and a real robotics milestone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Holy Grail of themed entertainment has been established for decades now: a fully mobile, bipedal character that matches the appearance, personality and scale of the original. Various non-mobile levels of this vision have been achieved at parks around the world, including the incredibly lifelike <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/07\/17\/disney-showed-us-the-inner-workings-of-its-avatar-robot-and-its-just-incredible\/\">Na\u2019Vi Shaman<\/a>, The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/27\/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life\/\">A1000 figure<\/a> that powers characters like Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge\u2019s Hondo Ohnaka and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bJtNxaTwgz0\">smoothly expressive Belle<\/a> from Beauty and the Beast at Tokyo Disneyland. There have also been some cool mobile experiments like <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/panzer\/status\/918301474404175874?s=20\">the self-piloting droid \u201cJake\u201d<\/a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The pint-sized character has accurately rendered textures on its face, hands and feet. It\u2019s dressed in a distressed red flight suit that you may remember from the films. And its eyes are expressive as it looks at me and waves. This is the moment, the one that Disney Imagineers and park goers alike have been waiting decades to realize. This is a real, walkaround character that is at the proper scale, kid scale.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A couple of weeks ago at Walt Disney Imagineering in Southern California, I saw just how close they finally are to making that dream come true. A bipedal platform, developed completely in house over the past three years by WDI researchers and roboticists \u2014 dressed up to look like a roughly two and a half foot tall Groot.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even though the version of Kiwi that I\u2019m looking at is Groot-flavored, it\u2019s important to stress that this is a platform first and foremost, which means that it could take this form when it gets to the parks, or another form entirely. It\u2019s important while developing a character to have a target character that can tell you whether or not you\u2019re hitting an established mark of believability.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kiwi also is still very much a work in progress. I wouldn\u2019t expect to see this in the wild soon; there is still a lot of work to be done on the way that Kiwi works and interacts with people, and WDI does not have immediate plans to put it in the parks.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But even at this stage it\u2019s an incredible feat of engineering that genuinely radiates that elusive characteristic that Disney always searches for with its figures: presence.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/6spi7nBqrro?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">How did we get here?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">I was able to speak to the lead on Project Kiwi, R&amp;D Imagineer Principal Scott LaValley, as well as Advanced Development Studio Executive SVP Jon Snoddy, about how the platform came together over the past few years.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cProject KIWI started about three years ago to figure out how we can bring our smaller characters to life at their actual scale in authentic ways,\u201d LaValley says. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for bipedal robotics and with an incredible team and our combination of technology, artistry and magic, we are bringing characters to life that could not have happened anywhere but Disney.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I\u2019ve talked a bit about the unique Imagineering process in my previous pieces on how Disney <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/08\/disney-has-begun-populating-its-parks-with-autonomous-personality-driven-robots\/\">builds reactive robotics<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/28\/disney-imagineering-has-created-autonomous-robot-stunt-doubles\/\">autonomous stuntbots<\/a> and even <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/27\/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life\/\">entire lands<\/a>. Imagineering works a lot like a startup in the way that it comes up with a problem to solve and then goes about pulling in other departments to help it get a solution. There is a remarkably ego-free nature to much of the way that WDI actually finds those solutions, too.

Unfortunately, due to the scale and complexity of the figure and the requirements for interaction and walking, no &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; platforms would do. The fact is that there are actually only a handful of truly viable bipedal robotics platforms anywhere in the world and the vast majority of them are being created for industrial applications, with a handful of &#8220;human-scale&#8221; solutions that are designed as marketing set pieces rather than truly autonomous systems.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So to hit that goal, Imagineering turned to R&amp;D and LaValley\u2019s team. LaValley came to Disney from Boston Dynamics, where he worked on the first version of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QQni8Uz3Q0I\">biped robot Atlas<\/a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The project scope was that they needed a biped robot that was battery powered and could be programmed to handle autonomous interactions with park guests and striped gestures and emotes. The team would take the next three years to build what they needed \u2014 much of which was custom for reasons we\u2019ll get into shortly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142973\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142973\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2142973\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg 3272w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=680,437 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=1536,988 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1317 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.09.35-AM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142973\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s clear at a glance that Kiwi has no operator inside. The human brain is pretty good at instinctually understanding whether a space is just too small to have a person in it. In order to achieve the small size, the team had to first build a custom skeleton that had room for every motor and actuator Kiwi would need to achieve 50 degrees of freedom, all while keeping it humanoid in shape so that it could be &#8220;dressed up&#8221; as any number of characters.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">First came the frame. Prototypes were built from custom-printed polymer and then eventually custom metal parts using industrial printers. The armatures and segments that they needed to house the critical components were just too complex to mill or cast. The cleverly printed metal skeleton is hollow throughout, allowing a &#8220;marrow conduit&#8221; for air which rushes through the body cooling the motors and actuators. In the current Kiwi prototype the air comes in through the collar area of the suit, flows throughout the body, propelled by fans embedded in the skeleton and exhausts near the bottom of the unit. Eventually it will use the clothing as a shroud to help air flow out near the feet.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Though there is some audible noise, even in this early state it is <i>very<\/i> low, allowing audio playing out of a speaker to enable conversation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As you can see in the exclusive progress video embedded above, the lower sections were built first. Early testing around the office shows the legs and torso sneaking, bouncing, shuffling and strutting through Imagineering. This is probably the only workplace in the world where the bottom half of a torso can tiptoe past your office while you\u2019re eating lunch and it doesn\u2019t even merit a pause between bites.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">An enormous amount of completely custom robotics work went into the Kiwi platform. In the demonstration I saw, young Groot had a safety tether and control cable for live programming, but nothing on the rig itself needed support, it was free roaming with on-board battery power that LaValley says hits around the 45 minute mark currently, with more longevity hoped for in the final version. In fact, a next-generation skeleton is already under development that is lighter and more efficient.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142971\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142971\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2142971\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"603\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg 3544w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=768,452 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=680,401 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=1536,905 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1207 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.10.46-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142971\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc. \/ Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The legs use a system that offers a kinetic counter-balance, allowing the force of having to move and plant a foot to be off-set, making motions more power efficient and quicker. Think of a spring-loaded heavy gate that makes it easier for you to swing open \u2014 but no springs, and a robotic limb instead of a gate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The feet plant realistically for the very simple reason that they must actually support the figure. This gives it an additional layer of believability that just doesn\u2019t happen with externally supported characters that \u201cfake\u201d a foot plant. LaValley demonstrated that the figure could easily stay afoot even if it was shoved gently or if a hand was rested on its shoulder. This kind of self-balancing is something that humans do unconsciously and continuously, but it must be built and programmed in to an ambulatory robot.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"D7TGB2slpL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/28\/disney-imagineering-has-created-autonomous-robot-stunt-doubles\/\">Disney Imagineering has created autonomous robot stunt doubles<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Disney Imagineering has created autonomous robot stunt doubles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/28\/disney-imagineering-has-created-autonomous-robot-stunt-doubles\/embed\/#?secret=D7TGB2slpL\" data-secret=\"D7TGB2slpL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">Many <a href=\"https:\/\/patents.google.com\/patent\/US20200369333A1\">patentable inventions<\/a> went into this creation. One of them is a clever system of gears that translates energy across joints, allowing them to share motors with one another even across a joint like a knee or wrist. This means fewer components and the ability to keep motor and actuator packages small and compact enough to fit underneath theming.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In order to minimize the amount of wiring throughout Kiwi \u2014 since wires are always the biggest points of failure \u2014 the team created a set of origami-like circuit boards joined by integrated flex cabling. Think of your standard computer circuit board but sliced into segments and mounted to the exterior of the hollow &#8220;bones.&#8221; They wrap around the limbs and other body parts, binding the control systems and motors being controlled into a local group that reduces the amount of harnessing that needs to be spread across joints and throughout the structure.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No actuators \u2014 the components that decide how to move a limb \u2014 that exist had the capabilities that the team needed, so they built them from scratch. At one point, LaValley handed me a ring holding iteration after iteration of a dozen actuator elements. I was holding years&#8217; worth of engineering, experimentation, failure and progress on a simple bit of wire twisted together at the end.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Up next for Project Kiwi is a new set of actuators that can dynamically apply torque plus added sensing capabilities for more stability and reaction to uneven ground or interactions. You can imagine that, as a free-roaming character people will want to take pictures with it and I doubt kids would be able to resist running up for a hug. The skeleton must be able to sense and react quickly and smoothly to those sudden external inputs in order to stay upright and keep looking natural.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2142970\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2142970\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2142970\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"748\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg 2884w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=768,561 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=680,497 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1122 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1496 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-6.11.38-AM.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2142970\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc. \/ Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D Inc.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Moving from a pure IK system to a fully torque-sensing system will allow for the platform to make on the fly adjustments that compensate for terrain or interaction with other performers or guests.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All of the work the team put into custom gearing, motors and actuation has paid off in spades with the ridiculously smooth and natural-looking movements of Kiwi\u2019s arms and legs.

Bouncy, jaunty walks, limps, sad or downhearted walks, all with the other motions of arms and head contributing to a constantly shifting center of mass and momentum.

Up next on the agenda is a sensory package that allows Kiwi to more fully understand the world around it and to identify people and their faces. This becomes important because eye contact is such an emotive and powerful tool to use in transporting a participant.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even without the sensing software, I can tell you that the experience of this 2.5ft Groot locking eyes with me, smiling and waving was just incredibly transportive.

But it\u2019s already well on the road to being viable for things like stage performances, photo ops and eventually free-roaming deployment in the parks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That is really the vision. Snoddy says that the goal is to move the characters we love from across Disney\u2019s pantheon into the spaces of the guests, elevating the entirety of the park to a live transportive experience, rather than a single ride or dark room. And to do it <i>at the proper scale<\/i> to make them genuine and capable of making guests believe. With these kinds of platforms, the possibilities are there to make the entire parks themselves a living, breathing home for the characters, rather than the tightly controlled environments of the rides themselves.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The arc of history in this Imagineering journey is drawn in robots. From Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, to incredibly expressive characters like the Na\u2019Vi Shaman anchored inside a dark ride, to characters that hold up in bright, well-lit spaces. Project Kiwi is the next frontier, allowing them to step off of the pedestal and right into the world of the guest.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the most fascinating fields in robotics currently is HRI, or human-robot interaction. This multidisciplinary effort to help humans and robots communicate better is often focused on safety and awareness in industrial settings. But I\u2019ve long said that the most incredibly interesting work in this space is being done in Imagineering R&amp;D. More than 100 million people pass through Disney\u2019s parks per year, and the number of opportunities that they have to react to and interact with robotic characters grows yearly. And with projects like Kiwi on the horizon, this field is going to explode with new kinds of data and learnings.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And, of course, we\u2019ll get to meet some of our favorite characters looking and acting as real as we\u2019ve ever seen them in our world.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The black curtain pulls aside and a character straight out of the movies waves hello. This is not an uncommon occurrence when I\u2019m around Imagineers, but this time is special. The character isn\u2019t a costume, it\u2019s a robot. And, unlike the m\u200bany animatronic figures you\u2019ve seen in the parks, it\u2019s not stuck in one place.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/21\/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake\/\">proposal<\/a>, put out by EU lawmakers on Wednesday, for a risk-based approach to regulating applications of artificial intelligence.<\/p>\n<p>The Commission&#8217;s legislative proposal includes a partial ban on law enforcement&#8217;s use of remote biometric surveillance technologies (such as facial recognition) in public places. But the text includes wide-ranging exceptions, and digital and humans rights groups were quick to warn over loopholes they argue will lead to a drastic erosion of EU citizens&#8217; fundamental rights. And last week a cross-party group of MEPs urged the Commission to screw its courage to the sticking place and outlaw the rights-hostile tech.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The EDPS, whose role includes issuing recommendations and guidance for the Commission, tends to agree.\u00a0In a <a href=\"https:\/\/edps.europa.eu\/press-publications\/press-news\/press-releases\/2021\/artificial-intelligence-act-welcomed-initiative_en\">press release<\/a> today Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski urged a rethink.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The EDPS regrets to see that our earlier calls for a moratorium on the use of remote biometric identification systems &#8212; including facial recognition &#8212; in publicly accessible spaces have not been addressed by the Commission,&#8221; he wrote.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The EDPS will continue to advocate for a stricter approach to automated recognition in public spaces of human features &#8212; such as of faces but also of gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals &#8212; whether these are used in a commercial or administrative context, or for law enforcement purposes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A stricter approach is necessary given that remote biometric identification, where AI may contribute to unprecedented developments, presents extremely high risks of deep and non-democratic intrusion into individuals\u2019 private lives.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Wiewi\u00f3rowski had some warm words for the legislative proposal too, saying he welcomed the horizontal approach and the broad scope set out by the Commission. He also agreed there are merits to a risk-based approach to regulating applications of AI.<\/p>\n<p>But the EDPB has made it clear that the red lines devised by EU lawmakers are a lot pinker in hue than he&#8217;d hoped for &#8212; adding a high-profile voice to the critique that the Commission hasn&#8217;t lived up to its much trumpeted claim to have devised a framework that will ensure &#8220;trustworthy&#8221; and &#8220;human-centric&#8221; AI.<\/p>\n<p>The coming debate over the final shape of the regulation is sure to include plenty of discussion over where exactly Europe&#8217;s AI red lines should be. A final version of the text isn&#8217;t expected to be agreed until next year at the earliest.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The EDPS will undertake a meticulous and comprehensive analysis of the Commission\u2019s proposal to support the EU co-legislators in strengthening the protection of individuals and society at large. In this context, the EDPS will focus in particular on setting precise boundaries for those tools and systems which may present risks for the fundamental rights to data protection and privacy,&#8221; Wiewi\u00f3rowski added.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qpk9eW29m4\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/21\/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake\/\">Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/21\/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake\/embed\/#?secret=qpk9eW29m4\" data-secret=\"qpk9eW29m4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2S1GZ3qLgL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/15\/meps-call-for-european-ai-rules-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public\/\">MEPs call for European AI rules to ban biometric surveillance in public<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;MEPs call for European AI rules to ban biometric surveillance in public&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/15\/meps-call-for-european-ai-rules-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public\/embed\/#?secret=2S1GZ3qLgL\" data-secret=\"2S1GZ3qLgL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dE2zyDsnO6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/12\/swedens-data-watchdog-slaps-police-for-unlawful-use-of-clearview-ai\/\">Sweden&#8217;s data watchdog slaps police for unlawful use of Clearview AI<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Sweden&#8217;s data watchdog slaps police for unlawful use of Clearview AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/12\/swedens-data-watchdog-slaps-police-for-unlawful-use-of-clearview-ai\/embed\/#?secret=dE2zyDsnO6\" data-secret=\"dE2zyDsnO6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"BHcyqcltVh\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/15\/2020-was-a-disaster-but-the-pandemic-put-security-in-the-spotlight\/\">2020 was a disaster, but the pandemic put security in the spotlight<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;2020 was a disaster, but the pandemic put security in the spotlight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/15\/2020-was-a-disaster-but-the-pandemic-put-security-in-the-spotlight\/embed\/#?secret=BHcyqcltVh\" data-secret=\"BHcyqcltVh\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The European Union&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor has called for remote biometric surveillance in public places to be banned outright under incoming AI legislation.

successfully launches astronauts with a re-used Dragon spacecraft for the first time"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">SpaceX has another successful human space launch to its credit, after a good takeoff and orbital delivery of its Crew Dragon spacecraft on Friday morning. The Dragon took off aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:49 AM EDT (2:49 AM EDT). On board were four astronauts, including NASA&#8217;s Megan McArthur and Shane Kimbrough, as well as JAXA&#8217;s Akihiko Hoshide and the ESA&#8217;s Thomas Pesquet.<\/p>\n<p>This was Spacex&#8217;s second official astronaut delivery mission for NASA, after its Crew-1 operation last year. Unlike Crew-1, Crew-2 included use of two re-flown components in the spacecraft system, including the first-stage booster, which was used during the Crew-1 launch, and the Dragon capsule, which was used for SpaceX&#8217;s first-ever human spaceflight, the final demonstration mission of its spacecraft certification program for NASA, which flew Bob Behnken (side note: this mission&#8217;s pilot, McArthur, is Behnken&#8217;s wife) and Doug Hurley to the ISS. SpaceX has characterized the use of re-flown elements as arguably even safer than using new ones, with CEO Elon Musk noting that you wouldn&#8217;t want to be on the &#8220;first flight of an airplane when it comes out of the factory&#8221; during a conversation with Xprize&#8217;s Peter Diamandis on Thursday evening.<\/p>\n<p>Now that the Crew Dragon is in its target transfer orbit, it&#8217;ll be making its way to rendezvous with the Space Station, which will take just under 24 hours. It&#8217;ll be docking with the station early tomorrow morning, attaching to a docking port that was just cleared earlier this month when SpaceX&#8217;s other Crew Dragon relocated to another port on the ISS earlier this month.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This launch also included a recovery attempt for the booster, with a landing at sea using SpaceX&#8217;s drone landing pad. That went as planned, meaning this booster, which has already flown two different sets of human astronauts, could be used to fly yet another after refurbishment.<\/p>\n<p>SpaceX&#8217;s Commercial Crew program with NASA continues to be the key success story in the agency&#8217;s move to partner with more private companies for its research and space exploration missions. NASA also recently tapped <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/16\/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon\/\">SpaceX to develop the human landing system for its Artemis program<\/a>, which will return humans to the moon for the first time since the Apollo program, and which will use SpaceX&#8217;s Starship spacecraft. For SpaceX&#8217;s human spaceflight program, the next big milestone will be its first flight of a mission made up entirely of paying private citizens, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/30\/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission\/\">which is currently set to take place this fall<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WuIGJlicdw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/30\/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission\/\">Last two crewmembers named for SpaceX&#8217;s first all-civilian human spaceflight mission<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Last two crewmembers named for SpaceX&#8217;s first all-civilian human spaceflight mission&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/30\/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission\/embed\/#?secret=WuIGJlicdw\" data-secret=\"WuIGJlicdw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"643JVncd0R\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/16\/whats-next-for-spacetech-9-vcs-look-to-the-future\/\">What&#8217;s next for space tech? 9 VCs look to the future<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;What&#8217;s next for space tech? 9 VCs look to the future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/16\/whats-next-for-spacetech-9-vcs-look-to-the-future\/embed\/#?secret=643JVncd0R\" data-secret=\"643JVncd0R\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SpaceX has another successful human space launch to its credit, after a good takeoff and orbital delivery of its Crew Dragon spacecraft on Friday morning.

crew mission to the International Space Station for NASA, with a liftoff time of 5:49 AM EDT (2:49 AM PDT) on Friday morning. The flight will carry four astronauts, including two from NASA, one from JAXA (the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and one from the ESA (European Space Agency), to the station, where they will begin a regular tour of duty conducting science experiments and maintaining and upgrading the orbital platform.<\/p>\n<p>This is the second commercial crew mission for SpaceX, which officially <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/02\/spacex-and-nasa-successfully-return-crew-dragon-spacecraft-to-earth-with-astronauts-on-board\/\">qualified its Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket for human flight last year<\/a>. NASA then launched four astronauts using <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/15\/spacex-and-nasa-successfully-launch-four-astronauts-to-space-for-first-operational-dragon-crew-mission\/\">SpaceX&#8217;s human-certified launch system later that year in November<\/a>, becoming the first private company to deliver people to the ISS, and the first American vehicle to do so since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011. Since the end of that program, NASA has relied on buying rides aboard Russian Soyuz rockets to keep up its representation on the ISS.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>There&#8217;s already a SpaceX Crew Dragon at the Space Station from that Crew-1 launch last year, and it was relocated to another port on the station earlier this month in preparation for the arrival of the one flying for Crew-2. The Crew-1 Dragon capsule is set to return to Earth with astronauts on board once they&#8217;re relieved by this flight&#8217;s crew, likely later this month on April 28.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Mb5rBb2V5t\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/15\/spacex-and-nasa-successfully-launch-four-astronauts-to-space-for-first-operational-dragon-crew-mission\/\">SpaceX and NASA successfully launch four astronauts to space for first operational Dragon crew mission<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;SpaceX and NASA successfully launch four astronauts to space for first operational Dragon crew mission&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/15\/spacex-and-nasa-successfully-launch-four-astronauts-to-space-for-first-operational-dragon-crew-mission\/embed\/#?secret=Mb5rBb2V5t\" data-secret=\"Mb5rBb2V5t\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>One major notable change for this launch is the use of a flight-proven Falcon 9 rocket booster. SpaceX has previously used new boosters fresh from the factory for its human launches, though it has a spotless track record when it comes to booster re-use for its cargo flights. It&#8217;s also the first re-use of a dragon spacecraft, and both components of this launch system actually previously supported human launches, with the first stage serving during Crew-1, and the Dragon capsule providing the ride for Demo-2, which flew astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley.<\/p>\n<p>The astronauts on today&#8217;s flight are Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur from NASA, as well as Akihiko Hoshide from JAXA and Thomas Pesquet from the ESA. As mentioned, liftoff time is set for 5:49 AM EDT, but SpaceX will begin streaming live hours in advance at approximately 1:30 AM EDT on Friday (10:30 PM PDT on Thursday).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Sz8OYpPDIx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/spacexs-spin-out-startups-are-helping-build-las-startup-ecosystem\/\">SpaceX alumni are helping build LA&#8217;s startup ecosystem<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;SpaceX alumni are helping build LA&#8217;s startup ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/spacexs-spin-out-startups-are-helping-build-las-startup-ecosystem\/embed\/#?secret=Sz8OYpPDIx\" data-secret=\"Sz8OYpPDIx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SpaceX is set to launch its second operational commercial crew mission to the International Space Station for NASA, with a liftoff time of 5:49 AM EDT (2:49 AM PDT) on Friday morning.

one is all electric. Next week, JOCO will be the first shared operator in New York City to launch a network of e-bike stations on private property for public use.<\/p>\n<p>The service, powered by shared mobility platform Vulog, will start with 30 stations and 300 e-bikes located around Manhattan, expanding to 100 stations and 1,000 bikes by June. This is not the first new shared operator to hit the streets of New York this year. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/14\/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot\/\">Last week, the city announced the winning companies of the e-scooter pilot in the Bronx<\/a>. But while Bird, Lime and Veo are restricted to operating in a section of the Bronx, far from any Citi Bike territory, JOCO is under no such constraints.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s bikes will initially be stationed at parking garages around the city, including at Icon Parking garages, the city\u2019s largest parking operators, but the company says it hopes to expand to residential and commercial buildings in the near future. The company essentially pays landlords to provide this amenity, while absolving them from having to operate or maintain the e-bikes.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWhat differentiates us from Citi Bike is, first of all, our bikes are 100% electric, 100% premium,\u201d co-founder Jonathan \u201cJohnny\u201d Cohen from New York told TechCrunch. (The two co-founders are both named Jonathan Cohen &#8212; one is from New York, the other from London.

To charge the e-bikes, the Lyft-owned company must manually take the drained vehicles from their stations to charge them, whereas JOCO\u2019s vehicles are charged at the stations. Like Citi Bike, each e-bike can last for about 30 miles on a charge.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough to get around Manhattan several times,\u201d said London Jo (another moniker for differentiating between the two Cohens). \u201cWe expect our vehicles to always be charged and ready to go for the customer. It defeats the purpose when you\u2019re taking a bike that\u2019s extremely sustainable, and then come along in a gas-burning vehicle to swap the battery. We\u2019re looking to be a truly environmentally friendly company and provide a more consistent and reliable service.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2019 and funded privately by a group of former CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and specifically investors with technology and real estate backgrounds, JOCO offers e-bikes at a price point that\u2019s comparable, if not directly competitive, to Citi Bike. It\u2019ll cost riders $1 to unlock the bike and .25 cents a minute, so a 10 minute ride will come out to $3.50. If you can find an electric Citi Bike, it\u2019ll cost a rider $3.50 to unlock and .18 cents a minute, which comes out to about $5.30.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s significantly cheaper in our opinion for a brand new, gorgeous, full-electric premium bike,\u201d said NY Jo.<\/p>\n<p>Neither company charges unlock fees for members. JOCO\u2019s monthly membership is $49 per month with unlimited use, and Citi Bike\u2019s is $20 per month, with monthly members continuing to pay 18 cents per minute, and annual members paying 12 cents per minute. Under Citi Bike\u2019s annual membership, if a rider is averaging out about five 10-minute rides per week, the monthly spend is comparable between the two companies.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCiti Bike has been around since 2013 and has done a tremendous job at driving cycling adoption on the streets of NYC,\u201d Monica Wejman, Vulog\u2019s North America managing director, told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd now you have JOCO entering this space, powered by Vulog, really there to complement Citi Bike and satisfy what we\u2019re seeing as a significant increase in demand for access to e-bikes. We\u2019re truly empowering mobility operators to launch mobility programs at scale.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While JOCO will not be reliant on the NYC Department of Transportation to carve out street and sidewalk space for docking stations, the operator is still taking steps to ensure a good working relationship with the city.<\/p>\n<p>London Jo says JOCO\u2019s bikes are made with safety-critical features, like hidden cables to make them less susceptible to vandalism, puncture-proof airless tires and bike-tracking, provided by Vulog\u2019s backend.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn addition, by operating in private spaces, we\u2019re eliminating that problem of sidewalk clutter for the city,\u201d said the British Cohen. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t have to worry about what has to go to fit 50 new bikes on the street. We\u2019re taking a big headache off them, and it\u2019s allowing us to stay in control a little bit more and not have to depend on the city.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8TxN4Lxx4E\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/20\/why-micromobility-is-poised-to-come-out-of-the-pandemic-stronger-than-before\/\">Why micromobility may emerge from the pandemic stronger than before<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why micromobility may emerge from the pandemic stronger than before&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/20\/why-micromobility-is-poised-to-come-out-of-the-pandemic-stronger-than-before\/embed\/#?secret=8TxN4Lxx4E\" data-secret=\"8TxN4Lxx4E\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Move over Citi Bike, there\u2019s a new docked, shared bike service in town \u2014 only this one is all electric.

connection with involuntary depictions of people, the technology is dangerous (and interesting) in other ways as well. For instance, researchers have shown that it can be used to manipulate satellite imagery to produce real-looking \u2014 but totally fake \u2014 overhead maps of cities.<\/p>\n<p>The study, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/2021\/04\/21\/a-growing-problem-of-deepfake-geography-how-ai-falsifies-satellite-images\/\">led by Bo Zhao from the University of Washington<\/a>, is not intended to alarm anyone but rather to show the risks and opportunities involved in applying this rather infamous technology to cartography. In fact their approach has as much in common with &#8220;style transfer&#8221; techniques \u2014 redrawing images in an impressionistic, crayon and arbitrary other fashions \u2014 than with deepfakes as they are commonly understood.<\/p>\n<p>The team trained a machine learning system on satellite images of three different cities: Seattle, nearby Tacoma and Beijing. Each has its own distinctive look, just as a painter or medium does. For instance, Seattle tends to have larger overhanging greenery and narrower streets, while Beijing is more monochrome and \u2014 in the images used for the study \u2014 the taller buildings cast long, dark shadows.

Regardless of a young company\u2019s struggles or success, sooner or later the question of when, how or whether to sell the enterprise presents itself. It\u2019s possibly the biggest question an entrepreneur will face.<\/p>\n<p>For founders who self-funded (bootstrapped) their startup, a boardroom full of additional factors come into play. Some are the same as for investor-funded firms, but many are unique.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tPut happiness at the center of the decision, and let your intuition \u2014 the instincts that made you the person you are today \u2014 be your guide.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>After 18 years of bootstrapping a BI software firm into a business that now serves 28,000 companies and three million users in 75 countries, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned about myself, my company, about entrepreneurship and about when to grab for that brass ring.<\/p>\n<h2>Profitable or bust<\/h2>\n<p>Starting a software company 7,900 miles southwest of Silicon Valley requires some forethought and not a small amount of crazy. When we opened, it didn\u2019t occur to us that one could have an idea and then go knock on someone\u2019s door and ask for money.<\/p>\n<p>Bootstrapping forced us to be a bit more creative about how we would go about building our company. In the early days, it was a distraction to growth, because we were doing other revenue-generating activities like consulting, development work, whatever we could find to keep ourselves afloat while we built Yellowfin. It meant we couldn\u2019t be 100% focused on our idea.<\/p>\n<p>However, it also meant we had to generate income from our new company from Day One \u2014 something funded companies don\u2019t have to do. We never got into the mindset that it was okay to burn lots of cash and then cross our fingers and hope that it worked.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Regardless of a young company\u2019s struggles or success, sooner or later the question of when, how or whether to sell the enterprise presents itself.
